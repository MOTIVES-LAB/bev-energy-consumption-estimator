# bev-energy-consumption-estimator
##Overview
The **BEV Energy Consumption Estimator** is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed to demonstrate the **Generalizable Energy Consumption Rates（GECRs）**. This tool calculates the driving features of any given driving profile and estimates the contributions of different factors to the energy consumption rate and the total energy consumption rate.

##Features
**Driving Condition Analysis**: Compute driving features for any given driving condition.
**Energy Consumption Estimation**: Estimate the contributions of various factors to the energy consumption rate and the total energy consumption rate.
**Visualization**: Intuitively visualize how the generalizable energy consumption rate estimates energy consumption for different conditions.
**Understanding Energy Consumption**: Gain insights into how vehicle energy consumption changes with different driving conditions and understand the underlying reasons for these changes.
